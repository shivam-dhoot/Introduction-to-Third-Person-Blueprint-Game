Introduction to Third Person Blueprint Game Tutorial Series Updated and recreated with Unreal Engine 4.9

This project is made by following https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZlv_N0_O1gZS5HylO_368myr-Kg2ZLwb series by Epic for Unreal Engine.
Videos are pre Unreal Engine v4.8 but this project is made with v4.9. Its pretty good for referencing stuff and good for newbies.
Wiki link for the tutorial series is https://wiki.unrealengine.com/Blueprint_3rd_Person_Game_Creation_Tutorials:_Intro

I've recreated the project till the last video except for editing particle effect. 
It will help newbies to get started with Unreal as many things have been updated and why I made this, quite frankly was just trying to update myself from v4.7 to new ones and had v4.9 installed in my laptop while travelling.

I'll do one more commit as to tell what stuff was changed but you'll get an idea.
Will add this link to wiki page and comments so that people can come and track it. 
You're more than welcome to change particle effect and add something if you want.

I'll surely do c++ battery project from tutorial series https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZlv_N0_O1gb5xvsc7VM7pfoRAKLuIcFi by Unreal Engine as it is also pre v4.7.
Expect that project too in v4.9 as my laptop has that +VS 2013 will work. Will make that project video by video as branches.
